## Main idea

Searching for the [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) tracker closest to my ideal idea of it I realized that, maybe, I should make my own pomodoro tracker in order to archive a sensation of satisfaction and confort while using it. Whether this is a good idea or not I don't know, I suppose I will find out while I work on it.

## Analysis

__What means pomodoro?__  
Tomato, it is the Italian word for tomato.

__What is that pomodoro technique about?__  
Working/Studying in specific time blocks.

__How are those blocks structured?__  
A work period followed by a short rest period and four of this pairs followed by a long rest period.

__How long are each periods?__  
Work -> 25 minutes  
Short rest -> 3-6 minutes  
Long rest -> 15-30 minutes

__How long is a study session?__  
4 work periods + 3 short rests + 1 long rest

25x3 + (3-6)x3 + 15-30

75 + 9-18 + 15-30

75 + 9 + 15 = 99
75 + 18 + 30 = 122

99-122 minutes

## Why "Xitomatl"?

> Pomodoro -> Italian  
> Red tomato -> English  
> Jitomate -> Spanish  
> Xitomatl -> Nahuatl  

There is no particular reason, I don't know nahuatl neither I have special interest in people knowing this word. I used it just because it was the first thing that came to my mind after "pomodoro".
